# Post-installation firmware operations (UNIT TEST VERSION)
#
# Run: fwup -c -f ops.conf -o ops.fw
#
# Tasks include:
#
# * `factory-reset` - Clear out the writable filesystem and any other writable
#                   areas so that they can be re-initialized on the next boot.
# * `prevent-revert` - Prevent `revert` from working until the next firmware
# * `revert` - Revert to the previous firmware if it's still available
# * `validate` - Mark this firmware as a good update.
# * `status` - Print out which partition is active (`a` or `b`)
#
# To use:
#
# 1. Run `fwup -c -f fwup-ops.conf -o ops.fw` and copy ops.fw to
#    the device. This is done automatically as part of the Nerves system
#    build process. The file is stored in `/usr/share/fwup/ops.fw`.
# 2. On the device, run `fwup -t <task> -d /dev/rootdisk0 --enable-trim /usr/share/fwup/ops.fw`.
# 3. Reboot after running `revert` or `factory-reset`.

  Return information about firmware slots

  Most Nerves devices have two slots for firmware storage. The first slot is
  usually labeled "a" and the second "b". Firmware updates alternate between
  these slots. In principle, a Nerves system could define more slots for other
  purposes.

  This function returns a map with the how the firmware slots are currently
  being used. It has the following keys:

  * `:active` - the slot containing the currently running firmware
  * `:next` - the slot containing the firmware that will be loaded on the next boot

  If you're a Nerves systems developer, this function works best when
  `Nerves.Runtime.FwupOps.status/1` is implemented. If not, a heuristic is used
  that tends to mostly work if your Nerves system uses U-Boot variables to
  track slots.

  Normally options are not passed. See `t:Nerves.Runtime.FwupOps.options/0` for
  modifying the behavior of `fwup`.

  Revert the device to running the previous firmware

  This switches the active firmware slot back to the previous one and then
  reboots. This fails if the slot is empty or partially overwritten to prevent
  accidents. It also requires the revert feature to be implemented in the
  Nerves system that's in use. See `Nerves.Runtime.FwupOps` for how this works.

  Normally options are not passed. See `t:Nerves.Runtime.FwupOps.options/0` for
  modifying the behavior of `fwup`.

  Specifying `reboot: false` is allowed, but be sure to reboot. It's easy to
  get confused if you don't reboot afterwards and do a double revert or
  something else silly.

  Return the device's serial number

  Serial number storage is device-specific and configurable. Serial numbers can
  be programmed in one-time programmable locations like in CPU ROM or
  cryptographic elements. They can also be in rewritable locations like a
  U-Boot environment block.

  Nerves uses the [`boardid`](https://github.com/nerves-project/boardid/) by
  default (set `:boardid_path` key in the application environment to another
  program to override). Boardid uses the `/etc/boardid.config` file to
  determine how to read the serial number. Official Nerves systems provide
  reasonable default mechanisms for getting started. Override this file in your
  application's `rootfs_overlay` to customize it.

  This function never raises. If a serial number isn't available for any
  reason, it will return a serial number of `"unconfigured"`.

  Mark the running firmware as valid

  A device cannot receive a new firmware if the current one has not been validated.
  In the official Nerves systems, this typically happens automatically. If you are
  handling the firmware validation in your app, then this function can be used as
  a helper to mark firmware as valid.

  For systems that support automatic reverting, if the firmware is not marked as
  valid, then the next reboot will cause a revert to the old firmware

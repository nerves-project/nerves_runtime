defmodule Nerves.Runtime.Init do
  @moduledoc """
  GenServer that handles device initialization.

  Initialization currently consists of:

  1. Mounting the application partition
  2. If the application partition can't be mounted, format it, and then mount it.

  Device initialization is usually a first boot only operation. It's possible
  that device filesystems get corrupt enough to cause them to be reinitialized.
  Since corruption should be rare, Nerves systems create firmware images
  without formatting the application partition. This has the benefit of
  exercising the corruption repair code. It's also required since some
  filesystem types can only be formatted on device.

  Long format times can be problematic in manufacturing. If this is an issue,
  see if you can use F2FS since it formats much faster than ext4. Some devices
  have also had stalls when formatting while waiting for enough entropy to
  generate a UUID. Look into hardcoding UUIDs or enabling a hw random number
  generator to increase entropy.

  # Use a fixed UUID for the application partition. This has two
  # purposes:
  #
  #   1. mkfs.ext4 calls generate_uuid which calls getrandom(). That
  #      call can block indefinitely until the urandom pool has been
  #      initialized. This will delay startup for a long time if the
  #      app partition needs to be reformated. (mkfs.ext4 has two calls
  #      to getrandom() so this only fixes one of them.)
  #   2. Applications that would prefer to look up a partition by UUID
  #      can do so.

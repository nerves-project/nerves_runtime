# Changelog

## v0.6.2

* Enhancements
  * Updates to docs and typespecs.

* Bug fixes
  * Read the U-Boot environment directly using :file if possible. (OTP-21)
    This fixes an issue with `fw_printenv` where multi-line values cause the
    output to be unparseable.

## v0.6.1

* Bug fixes
  * Log the output of system commands to that they're easier to review
  * Support mounting `f2fs` (requires support in the Nerves system to work)

## v0.6.0

* New features
  * Forward operating system messages from `/dev/log` and `/proc/kmsg` to
    Elixir's `Logger`. If the log volume is too much to the console, consider
    replacing the console logger with `ring_logger` or another logger backend.


* Bug Fixes
  * `cmd/1` helper improvements to interactively print output from long running
    commands.
  * `Nerves.Runtime.revert` would always reboot even if told not to.
  * Cleanup throughout to improve docs, formatting, and newer Elixir stylistic
    conventions
  * Remove scary suid printout when crosscompiling since nothing setuid related
    was going on.

## v0.5.2

* Enhancements
  * Added `Nerves.Runtime.revert` to revert the device to the inactive
    firmware. To use this, the Nerves system needs to include revert
    instructions. This is currently being implemented.

* Bug Fixes
  * Setuid the `uevent` port binary for debugging on the host.

## v0.5.1

* Bug Fixes
  * Split device attributes into only two parts

## v0.5.0

* The Nerves runtime shell (the bash shell-like shell from CTRL+G) has been
  moved to a separate project so that it can evolve independently from
  `nerves_runtime`. As such, it's no longer available, but see
  the `nerves_runtime_shell` project to include it again.

* Enhancements
  * Force application partition UUID. The UUID has previously been random. The
    main reason for change is to avoid a delay when waiting for the urandom
    pool to initialize. Having a known UUID for the application partition may
    come in handy in the future, though.

## v0.4.4

* Enhancements
  * Added installation helper for `Nerves.Runtime.Helpers`
  * Privatized methods in KV so that they don't show up in the tab complete
    and help screens.

## v0.4.3

* Enhancements
  * The `Nerves.Runtime.Helpers` module provides a number of functions that are
    useful when working at the IEx prompt on a target.

## v0.4.2

* Enhancements
  * Makefile only builds for Linux hosts or cross compile environments. Allows package to compile on other platforms.

## v0.4.1

* Bug Fixes
  * Fixed issue with the order of args being passed to mkfs

## v0.4.0

* Enhancements
  * Loosen dependency requirements on SystemRegistry

## v0.3.1

* Bug Fixes
  * Increased erl_cmd buffer size to 2048 to prevent segfaults with uevents for devices with many attributes.

## v0.3.0

* Enhancements
  * Removed GenStage in favor of SystemRegistry
  * Added KV firmware variable key value store
  * Added Init worker for initializing the application partition

## v0.2.0

* Enhancements
  * Moved hardware abstraction layer to separate project for further
    development
  * Start the shell using the name `sh` instead of `'Elixir.Nerves.Runtime.Shell'`

## v0.1.2

* Bug fixes
  * Cleaned up IO
  * Rename host to sh
